# folderer

This is probably not useful to you, but if you stumble upon it, feel free to use
it as you see fit. I wrote this as a one-off for my use case which was to take a
bunch of similarly-prefixed files, e.g.

```
My Movie (2020).mkv
My Movie (2020)-fanart.jpg
My Movie (2020)-poster.jpg
```

And move them into a subfolder:

```
My Movie (2020)/
  My Movie (2020).mkv
  My Movie (2020)-fanart.jpg
  My Movie (2020)-poster.jpg
```

It has no optimizations, just a quick and dirty thing to do what I needed. And
now that thing is done, and it's up here for posterity.
